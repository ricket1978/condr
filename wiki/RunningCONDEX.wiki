= Introduction =
CONDEX reads in the sample to be called, the other samples used as a baseline, and finds the most probable state for each exon. The output format is tab delimited and contains the following fields:
{{{
chr
need to fill in
}}}

= Options =
 * `-e <exon file>`: name of file with the list of exons in the chromosome
 * `-o <output file>` : name of output file. Default is StdOut
 * `-c <start>-<end>` : start and ending chromosomes analyzed (not used)
 * `-b <baseline files>` : comma separated list of exon files to be used as baselines (no spaces separating the list)
 * `-p <parameter file>` : name of file with the values of parameters. [something example]
 * `-threshold <value>` : threshold above which to call as CNV (allows more calling of normal state)
 * `-t` : prints timing metrics
